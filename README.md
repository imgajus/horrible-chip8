# horrible-chip8
A (horrible) Chip-8 interpreter in Rust, following guidelines by Tobias V. Langhoff (https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator). Uses fbmini for window management and rendering.

A minimal, functional emulator for learning purposes. Should work with most vanilla Chip-8 Roms.
